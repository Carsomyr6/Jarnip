It was commissioned at great expense by Sir Alrond, a wealthy nobleman from Athkatla who bribed his way into the ranks of the Order of the Radiant Heart. Eager to flaunt his newly acquired title, Alrond ordered an extraordinary suit of armor that no other knight could match. The result is indeed a masterpiece: ornate, intricate, and gleaming, this armor is virtually immune to enemy blows. Unfortunately, due to its complexity, it was also too heavy for Alrond to wear. Humiliated and financially ruined, he was forced to sell the plate and was shortly after slain by a gibberling. Though it reeks of vanity, this armor offers unmatched protection, provided its new owner has the strength to wear it.

SAY DESC @133 /* Cursed Berserking Sword +5: Bloodlust

Waterdhavian parents often tell their children the tale of Bloodlust: a cursed berserking sword with an insatiable desire to murder that ultimately turns on its wielder to quench its thirst for blood. The moral of the story is to not accept unknown magical items from strangers, and the sword was thought to be nothing more than a legend. However, it now lays before you.

The crimson blade is covered in bloodmarks, suggesting it is hundreds of years old. If the legends are true, it has caused the death of thousands, and countless innocents have fallen victim to its malevolent influence. The origins of Bloodlust are unclear, but it is evident that it was created for one purpose: to kill without end and unleash carnage across the Realms. 

The curse of this sword permanently marks the wielder: their hair turns white and begins to fall out, while their skin becomes ghastly and riddled with blisters. Over time, they lose physical fortitude and wither from within, inevitably leading to death. The only way to alleviate this affliction is through satiating the blade's desire for bloodshed, yet the curse itself may never be lifted. 

Once equipped, this cursed sword cannot be removed or unequipped by any known spell or ritual. The wielder has no choice but to obey and continue the slaughter. Only death can grant freedom from its curse.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Cursed
– Immune to Remove Curse
– Alignment changes permanently to Chaotic Evil
– Charisma set to 5
– Appearance changes: skin turns pale gray, hair becomes bone-white

Combat abilities:
– Body Wither: each turn the wielder must Save vs. Death (–5 penalty) or lose 1 Constitution and suffer 1d10 magic damage
– Murderous Wrath: On each hit, the wielder must Save vs. Death or go berserk for 2 rounds. When berserk, the movement rate is doubled and slashing damage is increased by 30%
– Blood Lust: Each successful hit heals the wielder for 2d4 damage and grants 1/2 extra attack per round for one turn. Killing an enemy restores 4d6 Hit Points, all lost Constitution, and increases Strength by 1 (maximum 25) for 10 minutes
