***Jarnip: A New Bonus Merchant in the Adventurer's Mart ***

MOD VERSION: 1.0   AUTHOR: RZABON   GAME: BG2, BG2EE, EET

INTRODUCTION:

This mod adds a new bonus merchant named Jarnip to the Adventurer's Mart. Like his colleagues Joluv and Deidre, Jarnip sells a variety of unique magical items to aid you during your adventures in Amn. Suffering from an excess of gold pieces in your purse? The prices of Jarnip's wares are among the highest in Athkatla, but his stock is carefully curated to satisfy the expectations of even the most demanding customers. This is the city of coin, after all, and now it offers treasures worthy of the greatest adventurers.

When playing BG2 on Insane difficulty with SCS/Ascension installed, the game essentially forces you to use certain items that lack viable alternatives (e.g., Defender of Easthaven, Flail of the Ages, Firetooth). Jarnip's wares are designed to address this issue by providing new, viable equipment that increases gameplay variety. The new items encourage tactical gameplay and support underrepresented kits and classes, such as Rangers or Monks. They should be on par with late-SoA unique gear, and their most powerful abilities are gated behind class and racial restrictions. Importantly, the items were designed to be used without mods that change the vanilla classes and kits; those may affect gameplay balance significantly.The exception is one mysterious weapon that Jarnip sells at a surprisingly low price, but discovering why is left for you to find out.

FEATURES:
- Adds a new bonus merchant, Jarnip, to the Adventurer's Mart
- 24 new items in total

DISCLAIMERS

This is my first mod. Although I tested it thoroughly, it is likely that certain things will not work as intended. Special thanks to the Gibberlings3 community, CamDawg, Lava, and Acifer for inspiring me to create this mod.
